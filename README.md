Optimization Project Description
In this project, I developed a simple yet powerful optimization model using Linear Programming (LP) to solve a real-world business problem. The core objective was to determine the best combination of products to manufacture in order to maximize profit, while satisfying operational constraints such as limited machine hours. The model was implemented in Python using the PuLP library, a popular and flexible tool for formulating and solving linear programming problems.

Tools and Technologies Used
Python: A high-level programming language ideal for data science and optimization tasks.
PuLP: A linear programming library in Python that allows users to define decision variables, constraints, and objective functions in a straightforward manner.
Matplotlib: Used to create basic data visualizations of the model output, helping to communicate the solution effectively.

Problem Overview
The case study revolves around a manufacturing business that produces two products: Product A and Product B. Each product requires a certain amount of time on two different machines, M1 and M2. However, the available machine time is limited due to capacity constraints. Additionally, each product contributes differently to the company’s profit margin.
The business needs to answer a key question: How many units of each product should be produced to achieve maximum profit, without exceeding machine time limits?
To solve this, I formulated a linear programming model with:
Decision variables: Number of units to produce for each product.
Objective function: Maximize total profit.
Constraints: Total time used on each machine should not exceed available hours.
How the Optimization Model Works
Define decision variables: These represent the number of units of Product A and Product B to produce.
Objective function: Maximize profit, calculated as the sum of each product's profit per unit multiplied by the quantity produced.
Constraints: Linear inequalities representing machine hour limits.
Solver execution: The model is solved using PuLP’s built-in solver which provides the optimal solution that satisfies all constraints while maximizing the objective.
The result indicates the exact quantity of each product that should be manufactured to yield the highest possible profit, given the constraints.
Applications of This Model
This optimization model can be adapted and applied to a wide range of real-world business scenarios beyond manufacturing, such as:
Retail Inventory Optimization: Determine the best mix of products to stock based on shelf space and demand.
Workforce Scheduling: Allocate staff to shifts in a way that covers required work hours while minimizing cost.
Logistics and Transportation: Optimize delivery routes and truck loads to minimize fuel costs and delivery times.
Supply Chain Management: Manage raw material allocation to different production units for cost-effective manufacturing.
Conclusion
By leveraging Python and PuLP, I created an efficient optimization model that demonstrates how businesses can make smarter, data-driven decisions. Such models are crucial in industries where resource constraints must be balanced against profitability, and they form the backbone of modern Operations Research and Decision Science techniques.
